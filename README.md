# Moyou

Moyou (jp. 模様, en. pattern) is a collection of [Metalama](https://www.postsharp.net/metalama) aspects that automate the
implementation of various different common software design and programming patterns. Currently, Moyou supports:
- Singleton (Moyou.Aspects.Singleton)
- Memento (Moyou.Aspects.Memento)
- Factory (Moyou.Aspects.Factory)
- Unsaved Changes (Moyou.Aspects.UnsavedChanges)

Examples of how to use (and how not to use) the aspects and the code they generate can be found in the
Moyou.CompileTimeTest project.
